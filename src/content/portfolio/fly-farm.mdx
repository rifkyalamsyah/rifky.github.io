## Overview

    Fly Farm is an innovative drone technology solution to increase efficiency and crop yields in agriculture. this is a personal project inspired by the stunning design of <a href='https://dribbble.com/shots/22691489-AgriFly-Agriculture-Technology-Website' target='_blank'>Dribbble shots</a> for Kretya Studio. This project aims to create an attractive and informative landing page for Fly Farm, a company operating in the agriculture technology sector. The layout and content are the same as the previous design concept, I only redesigned several layouts/components from scratch and implemented UI design to code (Front-End).

## The Process

1. ### Sitemap

   A sitemap is a list of all the important pages on a website. Before I created a wireframe for this website, I create the sitemap so that I understood the content structure of the website that would be created.


<figure>
<Picture src={sitemap} alt='sitemap fly-farm' formats={['avif', 'webp']} />
<figcaption class='text-center'>Sitemap - {frontmatter.sortTitle}</figcaption>
</figure>

2. ### Low Fidelity Design (wireframe)

   Low-fidelity design is a design asset that has the basic elements of a final design. It's used to evaluate design ideas and concepts. I created the wireframe directly in Figma to save time.

<figure>
<Picture
  src={wireframe}
  alt='low fidelity design fly-farm'
  formats={['avif', 'webp']}
/>
<figcaption class='text-center'>Wireframe - {frontmatter.sortTitle}</figcaption>
</figure>

3. ### Style Guide

   A style guide is a set of standards for writing, formatting, and designing contents. Before I design a high-fidelity design, I created some core style guides that will be used, such as font, type scale, and main colors.

<figure>
<Picture src={style} alt='style guide fly-farm' formats={['avif', 'webp']} />
<figcaption class='text-center'>Style Guide - {frontmatter.sortTitle}</figcaption>
</figure>

4. ### High Fidelity Design

   High-fidelity design is a prototype that closely matches the final design of a product or website. It's a polished simulation of a final product that includes visual design details. I created this website with two versions, namely light and dark mode themes.

<figure>
<Picture
  src={dLight}
  alt='high fidelity design fly-farm'
  formats={['avif', 'webp']}
/>
<figcaption class='text-center'>High-Fidelity Design - {frontmatter.sortTitle} (Light Mode)</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<Picture
  src={dDark}
  alt='high fidelity design fly-farm'
  formats={['avif', 'webp']}
/>
<figcaption class='text-center'>High-Fidelity Design - {frontmatter.sortTitle} (Dark Mode)</figcaption>
</figure>

5. ### Responsive Design

   Responsive design is a web design approach that ensures a website's appearance and usability remain optimal regardless of the device it's displayed on. I created this website with two mobile versions, namely light and dark mode themes.

<figure>
<Picture
  src={mLight}
  alt='responsive design fly-farm'
  formats={['avif', 'webp']}
/>
<figcaption class='text-center'>Responsive Design - {frontmatter.sortTitle} (Light Mode)</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<Picture
  src={mDark}
  alt='responsive design fly-farm'
  formats={['avif', 'webp']}
/>
<figcaption class='text-center'>Responsive Design - {frontmatter.sortTitle} (Dark Mode)</figcaption>
</figure>

6. ### Components

   UI components are the basic building blocks of a website user interface. They are elements or modules within a graphical user interface that display content or serve a specific function. I made two variants of UI components for the desktop and mobile versions.

<figure>
<Picture
  src={components}
  alt='ui components fly-farm'
  formats={['avif', 'webp']}
/>
<figcaption class='text-center'>UI Components - {frontmatter.sortTitle}</figcaption>
</figure>

## Conclusion

    The Fly Farm landing page is designed to attract attention, inform to visitors about this innovative solution for the future of agriculture. The modern and minimalist design, combined with clear and engaging information, will encourage visitors to get involved and support project Fly Farm.
