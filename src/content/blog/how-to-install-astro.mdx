# Install Astro with the Automatic CLI

> ## Prerequisites:
>
> - Node.js - v18.14.1 or higher.
> - Text editor - We recommend VS Code with our Official Astro extension.
> - Terminal - Astro is accessed through its command-line interface (CLI).

### Installation

## 1. Run the Setup Wizard

```sh
# create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest
```

You can run create astro anywhere on your machine, so there’s no need to create a new empty directory for your project before you begin. If you don’t have an empty directory yet for your new project, the wizard will help create one for you automatically.

## 2. Start Astro ✨

```sh
npm run dev
```

If all goes well, Astro should now be serving your project on http://localhost:4321/
