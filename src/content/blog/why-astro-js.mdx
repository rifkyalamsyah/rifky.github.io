## Why Astro?

`Astro` is the web framework for building `content-driven` websites like blogs, marketing, and e-commerce. Astro is best-known for pioneering a new frontend architecture to reduce JavaScript overhead and complexity compared to other frameworks. If you need a website that loads fast and has great SEO, then Astro is for you.

## Features

Astro is an all-in-one web framework. It includes everything you need to create a website, built-in. There are also hundreds of different `integrations` and `API hooks` available to customize a project to your exact use case and needs.

Some highlights include:

- `Islands`: A component-based web architecture optimized for content-driven websites.
- `UI-agnostic`: Supports React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit, HTMX, web components, and more.
- `Server-first`: Moves expensive rendering off of your visitors’ devices.
- `Zero JS, by default`: Less client-side JavaScript to slow your site down.
- `Content collections`: Organize, validate, and provide TypeScript type-safety for your Markdown content.
- `Customizable`: Tailwind, MDX, and hundreds of integrations to choose from.

## Design Principles

Here are five core design principles to help explain why we built Astro, the problems that it exists to solve, and why Astro may be the best choice for your project or team.

Astro is…

1. `Content-driven`: Astro was designed to showcase your content.
2. `Server-first`: Websites run faster when they render HTML on the server.
3. `Fast by default`: It should be impossible to build a slow website in Astro.
4. `Easy to use`: You don’t need to be an expert to build something with Astro.
5. `Developer-focused`: You should have the resources you need to be successful.
